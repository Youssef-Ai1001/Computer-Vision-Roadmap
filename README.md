Learning about model deployment and MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) as part of your computer vision learning plan is highly valuable. By learning about model deployment and MLOps, you acquire the skills to effectively deploy, manage, and maintain computer vision models in production. This knowledge ensures that your computer vision solutions are not only accurate and efficient but also scalable, reliable, and continuously updated. It prepares you for real-world deployment challenges and aligns your computer vision skills with industry standards and requirements.

By incorporating end-to-end projects and building a portfolio, you solidify your computer vision skills, gain practical experience, and demonstrate your abilities to potential employers or collaborators. It showcases your understanding of the complete development process and establishes you as a competent computer vision practitioner. Moreover, it provides a tangible representation of your achievements, facilitating future opportunities in research, industry, or academia.

In the action plan, I will add links to articles on how to build industry-level data science projects, in addition to the ten guided projects you can choose from them. Finally, I will add a link to 5 tools you can use to build your portfolio.
